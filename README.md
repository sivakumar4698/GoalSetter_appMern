# GoalSetter_appMern

### This is goal setter app developed using the following technology - MongoDB, Express, Node.Js, React.Js and React redux dev tool

#### Application features
- Register and Login
- Set goals
- View goals
- Delete goals once acheived

##### This application was developed using MERN stack. The idea of this application was to learn on how to use React Redux to develop a full end to end application. 

Outcomes of Learning

- Creating Redux store
- Getting store state
- Extracting the data needed by pieces of UI
- Making axios call to endpoints
- Performing redux actions.
- Creating redux features (Slice and services) which fetch data from backend.
- How to use slices to manage the state within the application
- In the backend, getting more familiar with using express for creating routes.
- Interactions with MongoDB, using mongoose models
- Creating middleware for authentication
- JWT token generation and verification
- Error handling 
- Getting more faimilar with creating components and pages with react

The overall experience was fun and informative.

#### How to Run the application

Have a look at the UI, I have made it look good and interactive

- Navigate to backend directory. - Run the following command "npm install"
- Navigate to frontend directory. - Run the following command "npm install"
- Now you have the node modules which you require.
- Next navigate to the root directory and run "npm run dev"
- I have also provided the env file. So, this should help the application to access the Mongo_URI and other details.
- Once the app is deployed I will put on the link here.
